# Here is a dummy Kripke model, with five worlds, all atomic propositions
# false in all worlds, and no accessible worlds for any world.

model
 w0 { a, b } w1, w2;
 w1 { b } ;
 w2 { a } ;
 w3 { } w4;
 w4 { a } ;
end model

#
# Your task is to extend the model so that all of the following formulas
# are true in the Kripke model.
#

a and b;

POSS (not a and b);

POSS not b;

POSS NECE (a and b);

POSS NECE (not a);

NECE NECE c;
